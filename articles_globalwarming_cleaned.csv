0;Over the past years the global average temperature has increased by approximately C and is projected to continue to rise at a rapid rate Although species have responded to climatic changes throughout their evolutionary history a primary concern for wild species and their ecosystems is this rapid rate of change We gathered information on species and global warming from studies for our metaanalyses These analyses reveal a consistent temperaturerelated shift or fingerprint in species ranging from molluscs to mammals and from grasses to trees Indeed more than of the species that show changes are shifting in the direction expected on the basis of known physiological constraints of species Consequently the balance of evidence from these studies strongly suggests that a significant impact of global warming is already discernible in animal and plant populations The synergism of rapid temperature rise and other stresses in particular habitat destruction could easily disrupt the connectedness among species and lead to a reformulation of species communities reflecting differential changes in species and to numerous extirpations and possibly extinctions;
1;Using the climate change experiments generated for the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change this study examines some aspects of the changes in the hydrological cycle that are robust across the models These responses include the decrease in convective mass fluxes the increase in horizontal moisture transport the associated enhancement of the pattern of evaporation minus precipitation and its temporal variance and the decrease in the horizontal sensible heat transport in the extratropics A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO and not in transient climate change scenarios All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lowertropospheric water vapor;Climate change, Hydrologic cycle, Model evaluation,performance
2;The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations creating a feedback loop General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere using static vegetation distributions and CO concentrations from simple carboncycle models that do not include climate change Here we present results from a fully coupled threedimensional carbon–climate model indicating that carboncycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twentyfirst century We find that under a business as usual scenario the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about but turns into a source thereafter By the ocean uptake rate of  Gt C yr is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source and atmospheric CO concentrations are  ppmv higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models resulting in a globalmean warming of  K as compared to  K without the carboncycle feedback;
3;This article reviews recent literature on drought of the last millennium followed by an update on global aridity changes from to Projected future aridity is presented based on recent studies and our analysis of model simulations Dry periods lasting for years to decades have occurred many times during the last millennium over for example North America West Africa and East Asia These droughts were likely triggered by anomalous tropical sea surface temperatures SSTs with La Niña‐like SST anomalies leading to drought in North America and El‐Niño‐like SSTs causing drought in East China Over Africa the southward shift of the warmest SSTs in the Atlantic and warming in the Indian Ocean are responsible for the recent Sahel droughts Local feedbacks may enhance and prolong drought Global aridity has increased substantially since the s due to recent drying over Africa southern Europe East and South Asia and eastern Australia Although El Niño‐Southern Oscillation ENSO tropical Atlantic SSTs and Asian monsoons have played a large role in the recent drying recent warming has increased atmospheric moisture demand and likely altered atmospheric circulation patterns both contributing to the drying Climate models project increased aridity in the st century over most of Africa southern Europe and the Middle East most of the Americas Australia and Southeast Asia Regions like the United States have avoided prolonged droughts during the last years due to natural climate variations but might see persistent droughts in the next – years Future efforts to predict drought will depend on models ability to predict tropical SSTs;Paleoclimates and Current Trends,Modern Climate Change,Assessing Impacts of Climate Change
4;Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to have significant impacts on the worlds climate on a timescale of decades to centuries Evidence from longterm monitoring studies is now accumulating and suggests that the climate of the past few decades is anomalous compared with past climate variation and that recent climatic and atmospheric trends are already affecting species physiology distribution and phenology;Climate change,Elevated CO2, Global warming, Phenology, Species distributions, Range shifts
5;More than countries have adopted a global warming limit of  C or below relative to preindustrial levels as a guiding principle for mitigation efforts to reduce climate change risks impacts and damages However the greenhouse gas GHG emissions corresponding to a specified maximum warming are poorly known owing to uncertainties in the carbon cycle and the climate response Here we provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis aimed at quantifying GHG emission budgets for the – period that would limit warming throughout the twentyfirst century to below  C based on a combination of published distributions of climate system properties and observational constraints We show that for the chosen class of emission scenarios both cumulative emissions up to and emission levels in are robust indicators of the probability that twentyfirst century warming will not exceed  C relative to preindustrial temperatures Limiting cumulative CO emissions over – to  Gt CO yields a probability of warming exceeding  C—and a limit of Gt CO yields a probability—given a representative estimate of the distribution of climate system properties As known – CO emissions were ∼ Gt CO less than half the proven economically recoverable oil gas and coal reserves can still be emitted up to to achieve such a goal Recent G Communiqués envisage halved global GHG emissions by for which we estimate a – probability of exceeding  C—assuming as emission base year and a range of published climate sensitivity distributions Emissions levels in are a less robust indicator but for the scenarios considered the probability of exceeding  C rises to – if global GHG emissions are still more than above levels in ;
6;The impact of projected global warming on crop yields has been evaluated by indirect methods using simulation models Direct studies on the effects of observed climate change on crop growth and yield could provide more accurate information for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production We analyzed weather data at the International Rice Research Institute Farm from to to examine temperature trends and the relationship between rice yield and temperature by using data from irrigated field experiments conducted at the International Rice Research Institute Farm from to Here we report that annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by C and C respectively for the period – and a close linkage between rice grain yield and mean minimum temperature during the dry cropping season January to April Grain yield declined by for each C increase in growingseason minimum temperature in the dry season whereas the effect of maximum temperature on crop yield was insignificant This report provides a direct evidence of decreased rice yields from increased nighttime temperature associated with global warming World rice production must increase by ≈ annually to meet the growing demand for food that will result from population growth and economic development Most of this increase must come from greater yields on existing cropland to avoid environmental degradation destruction of natural ecosystems and loss of biodiversity Achieving greater yields depends on increasing total crop biomass because there is little scope to further increase the proportion of that biomass allocated to grain Total crop biomass is determined mainly by crop photosynthesis and respiration losses both of which are sensitive to temperature Future crop yields will be influenced by complex interactions between the effects of increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO and trace gases such as ozone as well as the effects of temperature increases brought about by climate change Global mean surface air temperature increased by ≈C in the th century and is projected to further increase by to C in this century In the past century daily minimum nighttime temperature increased at a faster rate than daily maximum temperature in association with a steady increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations Although the effects of projected climate change on crop yields have been evaluated by using cropsimulation models there are few studies on the effects of observed climate change on crop growth and yield In the present study we analyzed weather data at the International Rice Research Institute IRRI Farm Los Baños Laguna Philippines from to to evaluate trends in mean maximum and minimum temperatures and solar radiation in both dry and wet cropping seasons Relationships between grain yield and temperature or radiation were evaluated by using yield data from field experiments conducted under irrigated conditions with optimal management at the IRRI Farm from to Our objective was to determine whether there were significant time trends in changes of temperature or radiation and whether these changes had an impact on grain yield;
7;As the Earth warms many species are likely to disappear often because of changing disease dynamics Here we show that a recent mass extinction associated with pathogen outbreaks is tied to global warming Seventeen years ago in the mountains of Costa Rica the Monteverde harlequin frog Atelopus sp vanished along with the golden toad Bufo periglenes An estimated of the or so species of Atelopus which are endemic to the American tropics have met the same fate and a pathogenic chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis is implicated Analysing the timing of losses in relation to changes in sea surface and air temperatures we conclude with very high confidence following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC that largescale warming is a key factor in the disappearances We propose that temperatures at many highland localities are shifting towards the growth optimum of Batrachochytrium thus encouraging outbreaks With climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity the urgency of reducing greenhousegas concentrations is now undeniable;
8;Historical records of precipitation streamflow and drought indices all show increased aridity since over many land areas Analyses of modelsimulated soil moisture drought indices and precipitationminusevaporation suggest increased risk of drought in the twentyfirst century There are however large differences in the observed and modelsimulated drying patterns Reconciling these differences is necessary before the model predictions can be trusted Previous studies show that changes in sea surface temperatures have large influences on land precipitation and the inability of the coupled models to reproduce many observed regional precipitation changes is linked to the lack of the observed largely natural change patterns in sea surface temperatures in coupled model simulations Here I show that the models reproduce not only the influence of El NiñoSouthern Oscillation on drought over land but also the observed global mean aridity trend from to Regional differences in observed and modelsimulated aridity changes result mainly from natural variations in tropical sea surface temperatures that are often not captured by the coupled models The unforced natural variations vary among model runs owing to different initial conditions and thus are irreproducible I conclude that the observed global aridity changes up to are consistent with model predictions which suggest severe and widespread droughts in the next – years over many land areas resulting from either decreased precipitation andor increased evaporation;
9;IN the past few years many workers have noted that the combined effect on climate of increases in the concentrations of a large number of trace gases could rival or even exceed that of the increasing concentration of carbon dioxide– These trace gases principally methane nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons are present at concentrations that are two to six orders of magnitude lower than that of carbon dioxide but are important because per molecule they absorb infrared radiation much more strongly than carbon dioxide Indeed a recent study shows that trace gases are responsible for of the increase in radiative forcing from to Fig An index to compare the contribution of various greenhouse gas emissions to global warming is needed to develop costeffective strategies for limiting this warming Estimates of relative contributions to additional greenhouse forcing during particular periods do not fully take into account differences in atmospheric residence times among the important greenhouse gases Here we extend recent work on halocarbons by proposing an index of global warming potential for methane carbon monoxide nitrous oxide and CFCs relative to that of carbon dioxide We find for example that methane has per mole a global warming potential times that of carbon dioxide On this basis carbon dioxide emissions account for of the contribution to global warming of current greenhouse gas emissions as compared with of the increase in radiative forcing for the s;
10;This paper demonstrates that US prestigepress coverage of global warming from to has contributed to a significant divergence of popular discourse from scientific discourse This failed discursive translation results from an accumulation of tactical media responses and practices guided by widely accepted journalistic norms Through content analysis of US prestige press—meaning the New York Times the Washington Post the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal—this paper focuses on the norm of balanced reporting and shows that the prestige presss adherence to balance actually leads to biased coverage of both anthropogenic contributions to global warming and resultant action;
11;The authors propose a new climatic drought index the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index SPEI The SPEI is based on precipitation and temperature data and it has the advantage of combining multiscalar character with the capacity to include the effects of temperature variability on drought assessment The procedure to calculate the index is detailed and involves a climatic water balance the accumulation of deficitsurplus at different time scales and adjustment to a loglogistic probability distribution Mathematically the SPEI is similar to the standardized precipitation index SPI but it includes the role of temperature Because the SPEI is based on a water balance it can be compared to the selfcalibrated Palmer drought severity index scPDSI Time series of the three indices were compared for a set of observatories with different climate characteristics located in different parts of the world Under global warming conditions only the scPDSI and SPEI identified an increase in drought severity associated with higher water demand as a result of evapotranspiration Relative to the scPDSI the SPEI has the advantage of being multiscalar which is crucial for drought analysis and monitoring;Precipitation, Evapotranspiration, Drought, Indices, Temperature
12;Climate models and satellite observations both indicate that the total amount of water in the atmosphere will increase at a rate of per kelvin of surface warming However the climate models predict that global precipitation will increase at a much slower rate of to per kelvin A recent analysis of satellite observations does not support this prediction of a muted response of precipitation to global warming Rather the observations suggest that precipitation and total atmospheric water have increased at about the same rate over the past two decades;
13;Several recently published studies have produced apparently conflicting results of how drought is changing under climate change The reason is thought to lie in the formulation of the Palmer Drought Severity Index PDSI and the data sets used to determine the evapotranspiration component Here we make an assessment of the issues with the PDSI in which several other sources of discrepancy emerge not least how precipitation has changed and is analysed As well as an improvement in the precipitation data available accurate attribution of the causes of drought requires accounting for natural variability especially El NiñoSouthern Oscillation effects owing to the predilection for wetter land during La Niña events Increased heating from global warming may not cause droughts but it is expected that when droughts occur they are likely to set in quicker and be more intense;
14;ONE effect of global warming will be to accelerate the decomposition of soil organic matter thereby releasing CO to the atmosphere which will further enhance the warming trend– Such a feedback mechanism could be quantitatively important because CO is thought to be responsible for ∼ of the increase in radiative forcing arising from anthropogenic emissions of gases to the atmosphere and there is about twice as much carbon in the top metre of soil as in the atmosphere Here we use the Rothamsted model for the turnover of organic matter in soil to calculate the amount of CO that would be released from the world stock of soil organic matter if temperatures increase as predicted the annual return of plant debris to the soil being held constant If world temperatures rise by C yr− the increase considered as most likely by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change we estimate that the additional release of CO from soil organic matter over the next years will be × gC This is ∼ of the CO that will be released by combustion of fossil fuel during the next years if present use of fuel continues unabated;
15;Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas the most important gaseous source of infrared opacity in the atmosphere As the concentrations of other greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide increase because of human activity it is centrally important to predict how the water vapor distribution will be affected To the extent that water vapor concentrations increase in a warmer world the climatic effects of the other greenhouse gases will be amplified Models of the Earths climate indicate that this is an important positive feedback that increases the sensitivity of surface temperatures to carbon dioxide by nearly a factor of two when considered in isolation from other feedbacks and possibly by as much as a factor of three or more when interactions with other feedbacks are considered Critics of this consensus have attempted to provide reasons why modeling results are overestimating the strength of this feedback Our uncertainty concerning climate sensitivity is disturbing The range most often quoted for the equilibrium global mean surface temperature response to a doubling of CO concentrations in the atmosphere is C to C If the Earth lies near the upper bound of this sensitivity range climate changes in the twentyfirst century will be profound The range in sensitivity is primarily due to differing assumptions about how the Earths cloud distribution is maintained all the models on which these estimates are based possess strong water vapor feedback If this feedback is in fact substantially weaker than predicted in current models sensitivities in the upper half of this range would be much less likely a conclusion that would clearly have important policy implications In this review we describe the background behind the prevailing view on water vapor feedback and some of the arguments raised by its critics and attempt to explain why these arguments have not modified the consensus within the climate research community;climate change, climate modeling, radiation
16;Despite the continued increase in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations the annualmean global temperature has not risen in the twentyfirst century challenging the prevailing view that anthropogenic forcing causes climate warming Various mechanisms have been proposed for this hiatus in global warming but their relative importance has not been quantified hampering observational estimates of climate sensitivity Here we show that accounting for recent cooling in the eastern equatorial Pacific reconciles climate simulations and observations We present a novel method of uncovering mechanisms for global temperature change by prescribing in addition to radiative forcing the observed history of sea surface temperature over the central to eastern tropical Pacific in a climate model Although the surface temperature prescription is limited to only of the global surface our model reproduces the annualmean global temperature remarkably well with correlation coefficient r for – which includes the current hiatus and a period of accelerated global warming Moreover our simulation captures major seasonal and regional characteristics of the hiatus including the intensified Walker circulation the winter cooling in northwestern North America and the prolonged drought in the southern USA Our results show that the current hiatus is part of natural climate variability tied specifically to a LaNiñalike decadal cooling Although similar decadal hiatus events may occur in the future the multidecadal warming trend is very likely to continue with greenhouse gas increase;
