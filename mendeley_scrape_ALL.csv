Transport and its infrastructure,Transport activity a key component of economic development and human welfare is increasing around the world as economies grow For most policymakers the most pressing problems associated with this increasing transport activity are traffic fatalities and injuries congestion air pollution and petroleum dependence These problems are especially acute in the most rapidly growing economies of the developing world Mitigating greenhouse gas GHG emissions can take its place among these other transport priorities by emphasizing synergies and cobenefits high agreement much evidence Transport predominantly relies on a single fossil resource petroleum that supplies of the total energy used by world transport In transport was responsible for of world energyrelated GHG emissions with about three quarters coming from road vehicles Over the past decade transports GHG emissions have increased at a faster rate than any other energy using sector high agreement much evidence Transport activity will continue to increase in the future as economic growth fuels transport demand and the availability of transport drives development by facilitating specialization and trade The majority of the worlds population still does not have access to personal vehicles and many do not have access to any form of motorized transport However this situation is rapidly changing
IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage,This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC Special Report provides information for policymakers scientists and engineers in the field of climate change and reduction of CO emissions It describes sources capture transport and storage of CO It also discusses the costs economic potential and societal issues of the technology including public perception and regulatory aspects Storage options evaluated include geological storage ocean storage and mineral carbonation Notably the report places CO capture and storage in the context of other climate change mitigation options such as fuel switch energy efficiency renewables and nuclear energy This report shows that the potential of CO capture and storage is considerable and the costs for mitigating climate change can be decreased compared to strategies where only other climate change mitigation options are considered The importance of future capture and storage of CO for mitigating climate change will depend on a number of factors including financial incentives provided for deployment and whether the risks of storage can be successfully managed The volume includes a Summary for Policymakers approved by governments represented in the IPCC and a Technical Summary The IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage provides invaluable information for researchers in environmental science geology engineering and the oil and gas sector policymakers in governments and environmental organizations and scientists and engineers in industry
Climate Change An Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,This Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups WGs of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC It provides an integrated view of cli mate change as the final part of the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Re port AR Topic summarises observed changes in climate and their ef fects on natural and human systems regardless of their causes while Topic assesses the causes of the observed changes Topic pre sents projections of future climate change and related impacts un der different scenarios Topic discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable develop ment Topic assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longerterm per spective Topic summarises the major robust findings and remain ing key uncertainties in this assessment A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers impacts of and responses to climate change and their linkages is shown in Figure I At the time of the Third Assessment Report TAR in information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise ie to derive climatic changes and impacts from socioeconomic information and emissions With increased under standing of these linkages it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise ie to evaluate possible development path ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid

Residential and commercial buildings,In emissions from the buildings sector including through electricity use were about GtCO GtCO eq NO GtCOeq CH and GtCOeq halocarbons including CFCs and HCFCs Using an accounting system that attributes CO emissions to electricity supply rather than buildings enduses the direct energyrelated carbon dioxide emissions of the building sector are about Gtyr For the buildings sector the literature uses a variety of baselines Therefore a baseline was derived for this sector based on the literature resulting in emissions between the B and AB SRES scenarios with Gt of emissions of CO in and GtCO in including electricity emissions but omitting halocarbons which could conceivably be substantially phased out by Measures to reduce greenhouse gas GHG emissions from buildings fall into one of three categories reducing energy consumption and embodied energy in buildings switching to lowcarbon fuels including a higher share of renewable energy or controlling the emissions of nonCO GHG gases This chapter devotes most attention to improving energy efficiency in new and existing buildings which encompasses the most diverse largest and most costeffective mitigation opportunities in buildings
Extinction risk from climate change,Climate change over the past approximately years has produced numerous shifts in the distributions and abundances of species and has been implicated in one specieslevel extinction Using projections of species distributions for future climate scenarios we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some of the Earths terrestrial surface Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a powerlaw relationship with geographical range size we predict on the basis of midrange climatewarming scenarios for that of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be committed to extinction When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken minimal climatewarming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction approximately than midrange approximately and maximumchange approximately scenarios These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration
Mitigation from a cross sectoral perspective,The economic potentials for GHG mitigation at different costs have been reviewed for on the basis of bottomup studies The review confirms the Third Assessment Report TAR finding that there are substantial opportunities for mitigation levels of about GtCOeq involving net benefits costs less than with a large share being located in the buildings sector Additional potentials are GtCOeq at a unit cost carbon price of less than UStCOeq with the total lowcost potential being in the range of to GtCOeq The total range is estimated to be to GtCOeq at a cost of less than UStCOeq and to GtCOeq at a cost of less than UStCOeq UStCeq As reported in Chapter these ranges are comparable with those suggested by the topdown models for these carbon prices by although there are differences in sectoral attribution medium agreement medium evidence
The UK Renewable Energy Strategy,To meet the challenge of climate change we need to save carbon in every sector of the economy this will mean a rapid transition to renewable energy This Strategy shows how we can reach our goal of of energy from renewables by Doing so will help the UK to lead the industries of the future According to recent analysis the renewable energy sector could support up to half a million jobs in the UK by It will help safeguard the security of our energy system The plans here can help reduce the UKs use of fossil fuel by around and so stem the rise in the UKs use of imported fossil fuels with our need for gas imports lower than they would have been in

Integrated Risk and Uncertainty Assessment of Climate Change Response Policies,This framing chapter considers ways in which risk and uncertainty can affect the process and outcome of strategic choices in responding to the threat of climate change
The Fourth Carbon Budget Reducing emissions through the s,The Climate Change Act requires that Parliament sets carbon budgets which define the maximum level of greenhouse gases which the UK will emit in a series of fiveyear periods to The Committee on Climate Change is required to recommend the level of these budgets to government which in turn must lay a proposed budget before Parliament In our first report in we recommended the level of the first three budgets covering periods and Parliament subsequently legislated budgets in line with our recommendations We are now required to make recommendations for the fourth budget covering the years This report sets out those recommendations In setting the first three budgets the feasible pace of emissions reduction was constrained by two factors first because the budget was set eighteen months after the first budget period had already begun second because reductions attainable in any year are dependent on technologies available and policies in place many years before The further ahead we look the greater the potential to achieve rapid reductions Our fourth budget proposals therefore represent an acceleration of the pace of reduction above that required in the first three budgets But not only is this acceleration possible it is also essential the pace of reduction in the first three budgets would not be sufficient to achieve the target which Parliament has set for – an emissions reduction of from levels A crucial feature of this report is therefore that we place our fourth budget recommendations in the context of the required path to To ensure that this path is feasible we consider what emissions will need to be in halfway between now and We have then designed our fourth budget recommendations to be consistent both with emissions in the third budget period and with the required level Despite accelerated emissions reductions in the s further acceleration will be required after with a total reduction of between and versus between now and This backending of the reduction path is unavoidable given constraints on faster early progress and acceptable given the wider range of technology options likely to become available over time But it means that our fourth budget recommendations must be seen as the minimum reductions necessary if the target is to be attainable If further analysis suggests that more rapid progress is possible a subsequent tightening of the fourth budget would be appropriate
Framing issues,"This paper argues for the necessity of universal health care as well as universal free education using a different argument than most that have been made heretofore It is not meant to conflict with but to strengthen the arguments previously made by others Using the second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence and the Preamble to the Constitution we argue that universal health care in this day and age has become a necessary condition if the ideals of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are to be more than an empty promise and if the discussion of ""promoting of general welfare"" in the preamble is to have any meaning"

Building a lowcarbon economy – the UK s contribution to tackling climate change,The First Report of the Committee on Climate Change December FOREWORD potentially of other greenhouse gases GHG which the UK will emit in each year budget period beginning with The Committee on Climate Change was appointed in shadow form in March becoming a statutory committee on st December when the Climate Change Bill became law Its core function is to recommend what the level of the UKs carbon budgets should be These budgets are established by the Climate Change Act and will define the maximum level of CO and years The Committee is required to make recommendations on this basis The Climate Change Act requires the Government to gain Parliaments approval to a proposed level for the next three budgets setting a trajectory of UK CO GHG emissions over the next This first report of the Committee on Climate Change therefore recommends UK carbon budgets for the three periods and In addition it covers issues on which we are required to report by the Climate Change Act or on which we have been asked by the Secretary of State to provide our opinion These include What should be the target for UK emissions reduction by Whether budgets should cover CO including the relevant non CO gases How far CO GHG emissions reduction should be achieved by domestic UK action and what reliance on emissions reduction credits bought from other countries is acceptable Whether and how international aviation and shipping should be included in the UKs targets and budgets And the implications of our recommended budgets for economic growth energy security the competitiveness of particular industrial sectors fuel poverty and for specific regions and devolved administrations The Committees recommendations on the first of these issues the target for have already been presented in a letter to the Secretary to State delivered on th October We recommended that the UK should commit to reducing its GHG emissions by at least below levels by Part I of this Report sets out the detailed analysis which underpins that recommendation Part II sets out our recommendations on the level of the first three budgets and the extent to which these should be addressed via domestic action versus through the purchase of boughtin credits from other countries Part III explains our proposed approach to international aviation and shipping and to nonCO gases and Part IV covers wider economic and social considerations The essential task of the Committee can be summed up as providing advice on how fast the UK can and should progress towards a lowcarbon economy and how it achieves that progress In developing that advice we have had to asses the technologies that are or might be available to deliver lowcarbon energy and increased energy efficiency the potential for consumer behaviour changes that reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions and the likely effectiveness of the policies presently in place or potentially applicable in future Around each of these there is significant uncertainty It is not therefore possible nor is it the role of the Committee to attempt to predict what the precise path to a lowcarbon economy should entail either in terms of technologies or policies Instead ourrole is to recommend a path of emissions which is appropriate as a UK contribution to global climate change mitigation and to identify whether that path is feasible at manageable economic cost given the range of different technologies and policy levers which could be deployed This Report therefore sets out alternative ways in which emission reductions could be achieved and assesses whether there are reasonable scenarios in which different combinations of actions would deliver the required emission reductions path The analysis clearly shows that the required reduction path is feasible of the Committee will then be to monitor actual progress in reducing emissions versus the budgets set We will provide our first progress report to Parliament in September In addition we will need to provide advice to government on how to fine tune the level of the budgets in the light of the results of the Copenhagen negotiations on a global climate deal We will also begin work soon on the analysis which will inform our recommendations for the fourth budget period which we will deliver by And there are a range of specific issues identified at various points in the Report where the tight timescales to which we have had to work have allowed only preliminary analysis and where we intend to do more detailed analysis over the coming year Once the recommendations of this Report have been considered by government and deliberated by Parliament statutory budgets for the UK emissions of CO The progress we have made so far would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the members of the Secretariat and the whole Committee would like to express our thanks to them GHG emissions will be set One role

IPCC MANAGING THE RISKS OF EXTREME EVENTS AND DISASTERS TO ADVANCE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION Summary for policymakers,This Summary for Policymakers presents key findings from the Special Report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation SREX The SREX approaches the topic by assessing the scientific literature on issues that range from the relationship between climate change and extreme weather and climate events climate extremes to the implications of these events for society and sustainable development The assessment concerns the interaction of climatic environmental and human factors that can lead to impacts and disasters options for managing the risks posed by impacts and disasters and the important role that nonclimatic factors play in determining impacts Box SPM defines concepts central to the SREX The character and severity of impacts from climate extremes depend not only on the extremes themselves but also on exposure and vulnerability In this report adverse impacts are considered disasters when they produce widespread damage and cause severe alterations in the normal functioning of communities or societies Climate extremes exposure and vulnerability are influenced by a wide range of factors including anthropogenic climate change natural climate variability and socioeconomic development Figure SPM Disaster risk management and adaptation to climate change focus on reducing exposure and vulnerability and increasing resilience to the potential adverse impacts of climate extremes even though risks cannot fully be eliminated Figure SPM Although mitigation of climate change is not the focus of this report adaptation and mitigation can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change
UK renewable energy roadmap update,The last year has been one of the most successful years ever for Britains renewable energy drive with big leaps forward in actual deployment in newly announced projects and in long term policy completion This update brings together the story of this rapid progress and sets out our shared high ambitions to go further than many thought possible just a few years ago As we see record levels of investment and large numbers of new green jobs being created already we are determined to do more to maximise the green growth potential of the renewable energy sector
UK Climate Change Risk Assessment ,This report fulfils the requirement of the Climate Change Act for the Government to lay before Parliament a fiveyearly assessment of the risks for the UK of the current and predicted impacts of climate change The purpose of this second UK Climate Change Risk Assessment report to Parliament is to outline the UK and Devolved Governments views on the key climate change risks and opportunities that the UK faces today These views have been informed primarily by an independent assessment of the available evidence on climate risks and opportunities which was commissioned by the UK and Devolved Governments from the Adaptation SubCommittee of the Committee on Climate Change The Adaptation SubCommittees UK Climate Change Risk Assessment Evidence Report sets out six priority areas needing urgent further action over the next five years The next two sections of this report provide the UK and Devolved Governments views on each of those six urgent priority areas Further action to address these risks will be considered as we develop the next National Adaptation Programme covering England and nondevolved matters and due to be published in The Devolved Governments each have their own policy and implementation framework and these are set out in Section along with their views on the specific risks that affect them In general the UK Government and the Devolved Governments endorse the conclusions of the Evidence Report prepared by the Adaptation SubCommittee with the exception of some of the conclusions on food security

Climate change and evolutionary adaptation,Evolutionary adaptation can be rapid and potentially help species counter stressful conditions or realize ecological opportunities arising from climate change The challenges are to understand when evolution will occur and to identify potential evolutionary winners as well as losers such as species lacking adaptive capacity living near physiological limits Evolutionary processes also need to be incorporated into management programmes designed to minimize biodiversity loss under rapid climate change These challenges can be met through realistic models of evolutionary change linked to experimental data across a range of taxa
Historical Overview of Climate Change Science,Awareness and a partial understanding of most of the interactive processes in the Earth system that govern climate and climate change predate the IPCC often by many decades A deeper understanding and quantifi cation of these processes and their incorporation in climate models have progressed rapidly since the IPCC First Assessment Report in As climate science and the Earths climate have continued to evolve over recent decades increasing evidence of anthropogenic infl uences on climate change has been found Correspondingly the IPCC has made increasingly more defi nitive statements about human impacts on climate Debate has stimulated a wide variety of climate change research The results of this research have refi ned but not signifi cantly redirected the main scientifi c conclusions from the sequence of IPCC assessments
Volume Chapter Introduction to the Guidelines,from the introduction Considers the concept of the self and its relationship to social behavior The self in theories of social anxiety which have been predominantly developed by social and personalty psychologists centers around the self as a relational malleable and multidimensional construct In contrast in models of social phobia developed by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists the self is typically a stable and unidimensional variable with relatively less emphasis on the relationship to others The authors conclude that these conceptualizations of the self have necessarily focused and perhaps limited scientists in their research efforts and that greater efforts in the future should be directed toward integrating these theories PsycINFO Database Record c APA all rights reserved

Sustainable Development and Equity,Since the first assessment report the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has considered issues of sustainable development SD and equity acknowledging the importance to climate decision making and progressively expanding the scope to include the cobenefits of climate actions for SD and equity the relevance of lifestyle and behaviour the relevance of technological choices the relevance of procedural equity to effective decision making and the relevance of ethical frameworks and equitable burden sharing in assessing climate responses This Assessment Report further explores key dimensions of SD and equity highlighting the significance of disparities across different regions and groups and the ways in which designing a climate policy is a component of a wideranging societal choice of a development path [Section ]
Climate Change Adaptation and Vulnerability,This article reconceptualizes current analyses of adaptation and vulnerability to climate change within an evolutionary theory of social change premised on the concept of a socially constructed adaptive landscape The latter describes a negotiated and contested fitness terrain Individual and corporate actors simultaneously adapt to and actively manipulate this terrain by using alternative collective action frames mobilizing resources and creating or exploiting political opportunities in order to legitimate or delegitimate social structures and their associated technologies at various levels of analysis Adaptation is conceptualized as occurring through homeostatic developmental rational choice and populational mechanisms Vulnerability results from the adaptive failure of social structures sustaining individual and collective health livelihood and wellbeing This framework combines organizational sociologists insights into structure–environment interaction constructionists attention to agency language culture and values and political ecologists concerns with power inequality and processes of marginalization
The velocity of climate change,The ranges of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate As temperatures rise ecosystems with nowhere to go such as mountains are considered to be more threatened However species survival may depend as much on keeping pace with moving climates as the climates ultimate persistence Here we present a new index of the velocity of temperature change km yr derived from spatial gradients degrees C km and multimodel ensemble forecasts of rates of temperature increase degrees C yr in the twentyfirst century This index represents the instantaneous local velocity along Earths surface needed to maintain constant temperatures and has a global mean of km yr AB emission scenario Owing to topographic effects the velocity of temperature change is lowest in mountainous biomes such as tropical and subtropical coniferous forests km yr temperate coniferous forest and montane grasslands Velocities are highest in flooded grasslands km yr mangroves and deserts High velocities suggest that the climates of only of global protected areas have residence times exceeding years Small protected areas exacerbate the problem in Mediterraneantype and temperate coniferous forest biomes Large protected areas may mitigate the problem in desert biomes These results indicate management strategies for minimizing biodiversity loss from climate change Montane landscapes may effectively shelter many species into the next century Elsewhere reduced emissions a much expanded network of protected areas or efforts to increase species movement may be necessary
Climate Change A report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,Radium occurs in flowback and produced waters from hydraulic fracturing for unconventional gas extraction along with high concentrations of barium and strontium and elevated salinity Radium is often removed from this wastewater by coprecipitation with barium or other alkaline earth metals The distribution equation for Ra in the precipitate is derived from the equilibrium of the lattice replacement reaction inclusion between the Ra ion and the carrier ions eg Ba and Sr in aqueous and solid phases and is often applied to describe the fate of radium in these systems Although the theoretical distribution coefficient for RaSrSO Kd is much larger than that for RaBaSO Kd previous studies have focused on RaBaSO equilibrium This study evaluates the equilibria and kinetics of coprecipitation reactions in RaBaSO and RaSrSO binary systems and the RaBaSrSO ternary system under varying ionic strength IS conditions that are representative of brines generated during unconventional gas extraction Results show that radium removal generally follows the theoretical distribution law in binary systems and is enhanced in the RaBaSO system and restrained in the RaSrSO system by high IS However the experimental distribution coefficient Kd varies widely and cannot be accurately described by the distribution equation which depends on IS kinetics of carrier precipitation and does not account for radium removal by adsorption Radium removal in the ternary system is controlled by the coprecipitation of RaBaSO which is attributed to the rapid BaSO nucleation rate and closer ionic radii of Ra with Ba than with Sr Carrier ie barite recycling during water treatment was shown to be effective in enhancing radium removal even after coprecipitation was completed Calculations based on experimental results show that Ra levels in the precipitate generated in centralized waste treatment facilities far exceed regulatory limits for disposal in municipal sanitary landfills and require careful monitoring of allowed source term loading ASTL for technically enhanced naturally occurring materials TENORM in these landfills Several alternatives for sustainable management of TENORM are discussed

Updated energy and emissions projections ,The Department of Energy and Climate Change DECC regularly updates projections of energy demand supply and greenhouse gas GHG emissions The last full set of projections was published in October This report updates those projections The projections take account of policies that affect energy use and GHG emissions where funding has been agreed and decisions on policy design are sufficiently advanced to allow robust estimates of policy impacts to be made The government has in place a clearly defined suite of policies to reduce emissions to meet the first three carbon budgets Therefore the projections for to indicate how we expect to perform against the first three carbon budgets based on a set of analytical assumptions table and figure The projections for the period onwards represent our expectations in the absence of any additional policy effort ie no new policies or extensions to existing policies They show that our suite of existing policies will continue to reduce emissions over the fourth carbon budget period but not by enough to meet the fourth carbon budget level The difference between the projections for and the fourth carbon budget level therefore indicates the amount of additional policy effort that would be required to meet the budget The
The Renewable Energy Review,This review of renewable energy was commissioned by the Government in the May Coalition Agreement It requested that we advise on the scope to increase ambition for energy from renewable sources This has important implications for the sector investment climate and Government policy In September we summarised our analysis of renewable energy ambition in a letter to the DECC Secretary of State We argued that the Governments ambition is appropriate and should not be increased Instead the focus should be on ensuring that the existing targets are met this requires largescale investment over the next years supported by appropriate incentives Our overall conclusion in this review is that there is scope for significant penetration of renewable energy to eg up to compared to today Higher levels subsequently ie to would be technically feasible Equally however it would be possible to decarbonise electricity generation with very significant nuclear deployment and have limited renewables carbon capture and storage may also emerge as a costeffective technology
Impacts of climate change on the future of biodiversity,Many studies in recent years have investigated the effects of climate change on the future of biodiversity In this review we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual population species community ecosystem and biome scales notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three nonexclusive axes time eg phenology space eg range and self eg physiology Then we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and subcontinental scales and we synthesise their results Finally we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms Overall our review shows that current estimates are very variable depending on the method taxonomic group biodiversity loss metrics spatial scales and time periods considered Yet the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity with the worstcase scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth
Climate change in prehistory,This book explores the challenges that faced humankind in a glacial climate and the opportunities that arose when the climate improved dramatically after the Ice Age It weaves together studies of the climate with anthropological archaeological and historical studies and will fascinate all those interested in climate and human development
The economics of climate change The stern review,Stern Review Report Stern Nicholas Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change Oct [hereinafter Stern Review] available at h pwwwhmtreasurygovukindependent_reviews stern_review_economics_climate_changesternreview_indexcfm Chapter Implications of Cli mate Change for Development There is now clear scientific evidence that emissions from economic activity particularly the burning of fossil fuels for energy are causing changes to the Earths climate A sound understanding of the economics of climate change is needed in order to underpin an effective global response to this challenge The Stern Review is an independent rigourous and comprehensive analysis of the economic aspects of this crucial issue It has been conducted by Sir Nicholas Stern Head of the UK Government Economic Service and a former Chief Economist of the World Bank The Economics of Climate Change will be invaluable for all students of the economics and policy implications of climate change and economists scientists and policy makers involved in all aspects of climate change
A globally coherent fingerprint of climate change impacts across natural systems,Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because nonclimatic influences dominate local shortterm biological changes Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions however debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC reveal several definitions of a systematic trend Here we explore these differences apply diverse analyses to more than species and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions Global metaanalyses documented significant range shifts averaging km per decade towards the poles or metres per decade upward and significant mean advancement of spring events by days per decade We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial signswitching responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends Among appropriate longtermlargescalemultispecies data sets this diagnostic fingerprint was found for species This suite of analyses generates very high confidence as laid down by the IPCC that climate change is already affecting living systems
Climate Change and Water,"""Observational records and climate projections provide abundant evidence that freshwater resources are vulnerable and have the potential to be strongly impacted by climate change with wideranging consequences for human societies and ecosystems The objectives of this Technical Paper are to improve our understanding of the links between both natural and anthropogenically induced climate change its impacts and adaptation and mitigation response options on the one hand and waterrelated issues on the other to inform policymakers and stakeholders about the implications of climate change and climate change response options for water resources as well as the implications for water resources of various climate change scenarios and climate change response options including associated synergies and tradeoffs"" p "

Economics of climate change,Estimates of the cost excluding environmental benefits of policies to avert climate change vary both in methodology and magnitude However the most reliable sets of estimates show that the standard of living of the present population would not be harmed and might be improved by sensible policies Estimates based on economy wide economic models tend to show only slight reductions in gross domestic product GDP from greenhousegas emissions reductions alternative estimates based on technical and engineering studies of the potential for costeffective energysaving investments tend to show modest GDP increases The assumptions underlying the estimates are important predictors of the size and sign of GDP effects but in all cases the most important determinants of material standards of living
Adapting agriculture to climate change,The strong trends in climate change already evident the likelihood of further changes occurring and the increasing scale of potential climate impacts give urgency to addressing agricultural adaptation more coherently There are many potential adaptation options available for marginal change of existing agricultural systems often variations of existing climate risk management We show that implementation of these options is likely to have substantial benefits under moderate climate change for some cropping systems However there are limits to their effectiveness under more severe climate changes Hence more systemic changes in resource allocation need to be considered such as targeted diversification of production systems and livelihoods We argue that achieving increased adaptation action will necessitate integration of climate changerelated issues with other risk factors such as climate variability and market risk and with other policy domains such as sustainable development Dealing with the many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues for example from the understanding by farmers of change in risk profiles to the establishment of efficient markets that facilitate response strategies Science too has to adapt Multidisciplinary problems require multidisciplinary solutions ie a focus on integrated rather than disciplinary science and a strengthening of the interface with decision makers A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frameworks that are relevant robust and easily operated by all stakeholders practitioners policymakers and scientists
Ecological and Evolutionary Responses to Recent Climate Change,Ecological changes in the phenology and distribution of plants and animals are occurring in all wellstudied marine freshwater and terrestrial groups These observed changes are heavily biased in the directions predicted from global warming and have been linked to local or regional climate change through correlations between climate and biological variation field and laboratory experiments and physiological research Rangerestricted species particularly polar and mountain top species show severe range contractions and have been the first groups in which entire species have gone extinct due to recent climate change Tropical coral reefs and amphibians have been most negatively affected Predatorprey and plantinsect interactions have been disrupted when interacting species have responded differently to warming Evolutionary adaptations to warmer conditions have occurred in the interiors of species ranges and resource use and dispersal have evolved rapidly at expanding range margins Observed genetic shifts modulate local effects of climate change but there is little evidence that they will mitigate negative effects at the species level
Abrupt climate change,Large abrupt and widespread climate changes with major impacts have occurred repeatedly in the past when the Earth system was forced across thresholds Although abrupt climate changes can occur for many reasons it is conceivable that human forcing of climate change is increasing the probability of large abrupt events Were such an event to recur the economic and ecological impacts could be large and potentially serious Unpredictability exhibited near climate thresholds in simple models shows that some uncertainty will always be associated with projections In light of these uncertainties policymakers should consider expanding research into abrupt climate change improving monitoring systems and taking actions designed to enhance the adaptability and resilience of ecosystems and economies
 Report on Climate Change The State of the Birds,In this State of the Birds report we consider one of the greatest environmental challenges of our time climate change How will the impacts of climate change influence our bird populations and their habitats Accelerated climate change as a result of human activities is altering the natural world as we know it diminishing the quality of our environment This report calls attention to the collective efforts needed to protect natures resources for the benefit of people and wildlife
Climate change and marine plankton,Understanding how climate change will affect the planet is a key issue worldwide Questions concerning the pace and impacts of climate change are thus central to many ecological and biogeochemical studies and addressing the consequences of climate change is now high on the list of priorities for funding agencies Here we review the interactions between climate change and plankton communities focusing on systematic changes in plankton community structure abundance distribution and phenology over recent decades We examine the potential socioeconomic impacts of these plankton changes such as the effects of bottomup forcing on commercially exploited fish stocks ie plankton as food for fish We also consider the crucial roles that plankton might have in dictating the future pace of climate change via feedback mechanisms responding to elevated atmospheric CO levels An important message emerges from this review ongoing plankton monitoring programmes worldwide will act as sentinels to identify future changes in marine ecosystems © Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
Climate Change ,The Synthesis Report SYR constituting the final product of the Fifth Assessment Report AR of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC is published under the title Climate Change This report distils synthesizes and integrates the key findings of the three Working Group contributions – The Physical Science Basis Impacts Adaptation and Vulnerability and Mitigation of Climate Change – to the AR in a concise document for the benefit of decision makers in the government the private sector as well as the public at large The SYR also draws on the findings of the two Special Reports brought out in dealing with Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation The SYR therefore is a comprehensive uptodate compilation of assessments dealing with climate change based on the most recent scientific technical and socioeconomic literature in the field
Climate Change and Food Security,Dynamic interactions between and within the biogeophysical and human environments lead to the production processing distribution preparation and consumption of food resulting in food systems that underpin food security Food systems encompass food availability production distribution and exchange food access affordability allocation and preference and food utilization nutritional and societal values and safety so that food security is therefore diminished when food systems are stressed Such stresses may be induced by a range of factors in addition to climate change andor other agents of environmental change eg conflict HIVAIDS and may be particularly severe when these factors act in combination Urbanization and globalization are causing rapid changes to food systems Climate change may affect food systems in several ways ranging from direct effects on crop production eg changes in rainfall leading to drought or flooding or warmer or cooler temperatures leading to changes in the length of growing season to changes in markets food prices and supply chain infrastructure The relative importance of climate change for food security differs between regions For example in southern Africa climate is among the most frequently cited drivers of food insecurity because it acts both as an underlying ongoing issue and as a shortlived shock The low ability to cope with shocks and to mitigate longterm stresses means that coping strategies that might be available in other regions are unavailable or inappropriate In other regions though such as parts of the IndoGangetic Plain of India other drivers such as labour issues and the availability and quality of ground water for irrigation rank higher than the direct effects of climate change as factors influencing food security Because of the multiple socioeconomic and biophysical factors affecting food systems and hence food security the capacity to adapt food systems to reduce their vulnerability to climate change is not uniform Improved systems of food production food distribution and economic access may all contribute to food systems adapted to cope with climate change but in adopting such changes it will be important to ensure that they contribute to sustainability Agriculture is a major contributor of the greenhouse gases methane CH and nitrous oxide NO so that regionally derived policies promoting adapted food systems need to mitigate further climate change

International Cooperation Agreements & Instruments,This chapter critically examines and evaluates the ways in which agree ments and instruments for international cooperation to address global climate change have been and can be organized and implemented drawing upon evidence and insights found in the scholarly literature The retrospective analysis of international cooperation in the chapter discusses and quantifies what has been achieved to date and surveys the literature on explanations of successes and failures International cooperation is necessary to significantly miti gate climate change impacts robust evidence high agreement This is principally due to the fact that greenhouse gases GHGs mix globally in the atmosphere making anthropogenic climate change a global commons problem International cooperation has the potential to address several challenges multiple actors that are diverse in their perceptions of the costs and benefits of collective action emissions sources that are unevenly distributed heterogeneous climate impacts that are uncertain and distant in space and time and mitigation costs that vary [Section ] International cooperation on climate change has become more institutionally diverse over the past decade robust evidence high agreement The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC remains a primary international forum for climate negotiations but other institutions have emerged at multiple scales global regional national and local as well as publicprivate initiatives and transnational networks [ ] This insti tutional diversity arises in part from the growing inclusion of climate change issues in other policy arenas e g sustainable development international trade and human rights These and other linkages cre ate opportunities potential cobenefits or harms that have not yet been thoroughly examined Issue linkage also creates the possibility of forum shopping and increased negotiation costs which could distract from or dilute the performance of international cooperation toward cli mate goals [ ] sal membership robust evidence medium agreement The UNFCCC continues to develop institutions and systems for governance of cli mate change [ ] NonUN forums and coalitions of nonstate actors such as pri vate businesses and citylevel governments are also contrib uting to international cooperation on climate change medium evidence medium agreement These forums and coalitions address issues including deforestation technology transfer adaptation and fossil fuel subsidies However their actual mitigation performance is unclear [ ] International cooperation may have a role in stimulating pub lic investment financial incentives and regulations to promote technological innovation thereby more actively engaging the private sector with the climate regime medium evidence medium agreement Technology policy can help lower mitigation costs thereby increasing incentives for participation and compliance with interna tional cooperative efforts particularly in the long run Equity issues can be affected by domestic intellectual property rights regimes which can alter the rate of both technology transfer and the development of new technologies [ ] In the absence of — or as a complement to — a binding inter national agreement on climate change policy linkages among existing and nascent regional national and subnational cli mate policies offer potential climate change mitigation and adaptation benefits medium evidence medium agreement [ ] Direct and indirect linkages between and among sub national national and regional carbon markets are being pursued to improve market efficiency Yet integrating climate policies raises a number of concerns about the performance of a system of linked legal rules and economic activities Linkage between carbon markets can be stimulated by competition between and among public and private governance regimes accountability measures and the desire to learn from policy experiments [ Figure ] Existing and proposed international climate agreements vary in the degree to which their authority is centralized robust evidence high agreement The range of centralized formalization spans strong multilateral agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol tar gets harmonized national policies such as the Copenhagen Cancún pledges and decentralized but coordinated national policies such as planned linkages of national and subnational emissions trading schemes [ ] Additionally potential agreements vary in their degree of legal bindingness [] Three other design ele ments of international agreements have particular relevance goals and targets flexible mechanisms and equitable methods for effort sharing [] The UNFCCC is currently the only international climate policy venue with broad legitimacy due in part to its virtually univer While a number of new institutions are focused on adaptation funding and coordination adaptation has historically received less attention than mitigation in international climate policy but inclusion of adaptation is increasingly important to reduce damages and may engage a greater number of countries robust evidence medium agreement Other possible complementarities and tradeoffs between mitigation and adaptation particularly the temporal distribution of actions are not wellunderstood [ ] Participation in international cooperation on climate change can be enhanced by monetary transfers marketbased mecha nisms technology transfer and traderelated measures robust evidence medium agreement These mechanisms to enhance partici pation along with compliance legitimacy and flexibility affect the institutional feasibility of international climate policy [ ] International trade can offer a range of positive and negative incentives to promote international cooperation on climate change robust evidence medium agreement Three issues are key to developing constructive relationships between international trade and climate agreements how existing trade policies and rules can be modi fied to be more climate friendly whether border adjustment measures BAMs or other trade measures can be effective in meeting the goals of international climate agreements whether the UNFCCC World Trade Organization WTO hybrid of the two or a new institution is the best forum for a tradeandclimate architecture [] Climate change policies can be evaluated using four criteria environmental effectiveness aggregate economic performance distributional impacts and institutional feasibility These criteria are grounded in several principles maximizing global net benefits equity and the related principles of distributive justice and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities CBDRRC precaution and the related principles of anticipation and prevention of future risks and sustainable development These criteria may at times conflict forcing tradeoffs among them [ ] International cooperation has produced political agreement regarding a longterm goal of limiting global temperature increase to no more than C above preindustrial levels but the overall level of mitigation achieved to date by cooperation appears inadequate to achieve this goal robust evidence medium agreement Mitigation pledges by individual countries in the Copen hagenCancún regime if fully implemented will help reduce emissions in to below the projected businessasusual level but are unlikely to attain an emission level in consistent with costeffective path ways based on the immediate onset of mitigation that achieve the longterm C goal with a greater than probability The contribu tion of international cooperation outside of the UNFCCC is largely not quantified [ ] The Kyoto Protocol was the first binding step toward imple menting the principles and goals provided by the UNFCCC but it has had limited effects on global emissions because some countries did not ratify the Protocol some Parties did not meet their commitments and its commitments applied to only a por tion of the global economy medium evidence low agreement The Parties collectively surpassed their collective emission reduc tion target in the first commitment period but the Protocol credited emissions reductions that would have occurred even in its absence The Kyoto Protocol does not directly influence the emissions of non Annex I countries which have grown rapidly over the past decade [] The flexible mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol have gener ally helped to improve its economic performance but their envi ronmental effectiveness is less clear medium evidence medium agreement The Clean Development Mechanism CDM created a mar ket for emissions offsets from developing countries generating credits equivalent to nearly billion tCO eq as of October many of which have been generated by lowcost mitigation technologies The CDM showed institutional feasibility of a projectbased market mecha nism under widely varying circumstances The CDMs environmental effectiveness has been mixed due to concerns about the additionality of projects the validity of baselines the possibility of emissions leak age and recent price decreases Its distributional impacts were limited due to the concentration of projects in a limited number of countries The Protocols other flexible mechanisms Joint Implementation and International Emissions Trading have been undertaken both by gov ernments and private market participants but have raised concerns related to government sales of emissi

Modern Global Climate Change,Modern climate change is dominated by human influences which are now large enough to exceed the bounds of natural variability The main source of global climate change is humaninduced changes in atmospheric composition These perturbations primarily result from emissions associated with energy use but on local and regional scales urbanization and land use changes are also important Although there has been progress in monitoring and understanding climate change there remain many scientific technical and institutional impediments to precisely planning for adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change There is still considerable uncertainty about the rates of change that can be expected but it is clear that these changes will be increasingly manifested in important and tangible ways such as changes in extremes of temperature and precipitation decreases in seasonal and perennial snow and ice extent and sea level rise Anthropogenic climate change is now likely to continue for many centuries We are venturing into the unknown with climate and its associated impacts could be quite disruptive

Building a lowcarbon economy – the UK s contribution to tackling climate change,The First Report of the Committee on Climate Change December FOREWORD potentially of other greenhouse gases GHG which the UK will emit in each year budget period beginning with The Committee on Climate Change was appointed in shadow form in March becoming a statutory committee on st December when the Climate Change Bill became law Its core function is to recommend what the level of the UKs carbon budgets should be These budgets are established by the Climate Change Act and will define the maximum level of CO and years The Committee is required to make recommendations on this basis The Climate Change Act requires the Government to gain Parliaments approval to a proposed level for the next three budgets setting a trajectory of UK CO GHG emissions over the next This first report of the Committee on Climate Change therefore recommends UK carbon budgets for the three periods and In addition it covers issues on which we are required to report by the Climate Change Act or on which we have been asked by the Secretary of State to provide our opinion These include What should be the target for UK emissions reduction by Whether budgets should cover CO including the relevant non CO gases How far CO GHG emissions reduction should be achieved by domestic UK action and what reliance on emissions reduction credits bought from other countries is acceptable Whether and how international aviation and shipping should be included in the UKs targets and budgets And the implications of our recommended budgets for economic growth energy security the competitiveness of particular industrial sectors fuel poverty and for specific regions and devolved administrations The Committees recommendations on the first of these issues the target for have already been presented in a letter to the Secretary to State delivered on th October We recommended that the UK should commit to reducing its GHG emissions by at least below levels by Part I of this Report sets out the detailed analysis which underpins that recommendation Part II sets out our recommendations on the level of the first three budgets and the extent to which these should be addressed via domestic action versus through the purchase of boughtin credits from other countries Part III explains our proposed approach to international aviation and shipping and to nonCO gases and Part IV covers wider economic and social considerations The essential task of the Committee can be summed up as providing advice on how fast the UK can and should progress towards a lowcarbon economy and how it achieves that progress In developing that advice we have had to asses the technologies that are or might be available to deliver lowcarbon energy and increased energy efficiency the potential for consumer behaviour changes that reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions and the likely effectiveness of the policies presently in place or potentially applicable in future Around each of these there is significant uncertainty It is not therefore possible nor is it the role of the Committee to attempt to predict what the precise path to a lowcarbon economy should entail either in terms of technologies or policies Instead ourrole is to recommend a path of emissions which is appropriate as a UK contribution to global climate change mitigation and to identify whether that path is feasible at manageable economic cost given the range of different technologies and policy levers which could be deployed This Report therefore sets out alternative ways in which emission reductions could be achieved and assesses whether there are reasonable scenarios in which different combinations of actions would deliver the required emission reductions path The analysis clearly shows that the required reduction path is feasible of the Committee will then be to monitor actual progress in reducing emissions versus the budgets set We will provide our first progress report to Parliament in September In addition we will need to provide advice to government on how to fine tune the level of the budgets in the light of the results of the Copenhagen negotiations on a global climate deal We will also begin work soon on the analysis which will inform our recommendations for the fourth budget period which we will deliver by And there are a range of specific issues identified at various points in the Report where the tight timescales to which we have had to work have allowed only preliminary analysis and where we intend to do more detailed analysis over the coming year Once the recommendations of this Report have been considered by government and deliberated by Parliament statutory budgets for the UK emissions of CO The progress we have made so far would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the members of the Secretariat and the whole Committee would like to express our thanks to them GHG emissions will be set One role

Tropical cyclones and climate change,Whether the characteristics of tropical cyclones have changed or will change in a warming climate — and if so how — has been the subject of considerable investigation often with conflicting results Large amplitude fluctuations in the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones greatly complicate both the detection of longterm trends and their attribution to rising levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases Trend detection is further impeded by substantial limitations in the availability and quality of global historical records of tropical cyclones Therefore it remains uncertain whether past changes in tropical cyclone activity have exceeded the variability expected from natural causes However future projections based on theory and highresolution dynamical models consistently indicate that greenhouse warming will cause the globally averaged intensity of tropical cyclones to shift towards stronger storms with intensity increases of – by Existing modelling studies also consistently project decreases in the globally averaged frequency of tropical cyclones by – Balanced against this higher resolution modelling studies typically project substantial increases in the frequency of the most intense cyclones and increases of the order of in the precipitation rate within km of the storm centre For all cyclone parameters projected changes for individual basins show large variations between different modelling studies
Human perception of climate change,"""Climate dice"" describing the chance of unusually warm or cool seasons have become more and more ""loaded"" in the past y coincident with rapid global warming The distribution of seasonal mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher temperatures and the range of anomalies has increased An important change is the emergence of a category of summertime extremely hot outliers more than three standard deviations sigma warmer than the climatology of the base period This hot extreme which covered much less than of Earths surface during the base period now typically covers about of the land area It follows that we can state with a high degree of confidence that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in and Moscow in were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small We discuss practical implications of this substantial growing climate change"
Forests and climate change Forcings feedbacks and the climate benefits of forests,The worlds forests influence climate through physical chemical and biological processes that affect planetary energetics the hydrologic cycle and atmospheric composition These complex and nonlinear forestatmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change Tropical temperate and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change

Are there social limits to adaptation to climate change,While there is a recognised need to adapt to changing climatic conditions there is an emerging discourse of limits to such adaptation Limits are traditionally analysed as a set of immutable thresholds in biological economic or technological parameters This paper contends that limits to adaptation are endogenous to society and hence contingent on ethics knowledge attitudes to risk and culture We review insights from history sociology and psychology of risk economics and political science to develop four propositions concerning limits to adaptation First any limits to adaptation depend on the ultimate goals of adaptation underpinned by diverse values Second adaptation need not be limited by uncertainty around future foresight of risk Third social and individual factors limit adaptation action Fourth systematic undervaluation of loss of places and culture disguises real experienced but subjective limits to adaptationWeconclude that these issues of values and ethics risk knowledge and culture construct societal limits to adaptation but that these limits are mutable
Observations surface and atmospheric climate change,Global mean surface temperatures have risen by C C when estimated by a linear trend over the last years The rate of warming over the last years is almost double that over the last years C C vs C C per decade Global mean temperatures averaged over land and ocean surfaces from three different estimates each of which has been independently adjusted for various homogeneity issues are consistent within uncertainty estimates over the period to and show similar rates of increase in recent decades The trend is not linear and the warming from the fi rst years of instrumental record to the last years is C C
Climate climate change and range boundaries,Aim A major issue in ecology biogeography conservation biology and invasion biology is the extent to which climate and hence climate change contributes to the positions of species range boundaries Thirty years of rapid climate warming provides an excellent opportunity to test the hypothesis that climate acts as a major constraint on range boundaries treating anthropogenic climate change as a largescale experiment Location UK and global data and literature Methods This article analyses the frequencies with which species have responded to climate change by shifting their range boundaries It does not consider abundance or other changes Results For the majority of species boundaries shifted in a direction that is concordant with being a response to climate change of all species have expanded in a polewards direction as the climate has warmed for the best data available which represents an excess of of species after taking account of the fact that some species may shift in this direction for nonclimatic reasons Other data sets also show an excess of animal range boundaries expanding in the expected direction Main conclusions Climate is likely to contribute to the majority of terrestrial and freshwater range boundaries This generalization excludes species that are endemic to specific islands lakes rivers and geological outcrops although these local endemics are not immune from the effects of climate change The observed shifts associated with recent climate change are likely to have been brought about through both direct and indirect changes to species interactions effects of climate indirect effects are discussed in relation to laboratory experiments and invasive species Recent observations of range boundary shifts are consistent with the hypothesis that climate contributes to but is not the sole determinant of the position of the range boundaries of the majority of terrestrial animal species
Climate Change and Food Systems,Food systems contribute – of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas GHG emissions releasing – megatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent MtCOe in Agricultural production including indirect emissions associated with landcover change contributes – of total food system emissions with significant regional variation The impacts of global climate change on food systems are expected to be widespread complex geographically and temporally variable and profoundly influenced by socioeconomic conditions Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models provide evidence that climate change will affect agricultural yields and earnings food prices reliability of delivery food quality and notably food safety Lowincome producers and consumers of food will be more vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited ability to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies under increasing climatic risks Some synergies among food security adaptation and mitigation are feasible But promising interventions such as agricultural intensification or reductions in waste will require careful management to distribute costs and benefits effectively
Changes in precipitation with climate change,There is a direct influence of global warming on precipitation Increased heating leads to greater evaporation and thus surface drying thereby increasing the intensity and duration of drought However the water holding capacity of air increases by about per C warming which leads to increased water vapor in the atmosphere Hence storms whether individual thunderstorms extratropical rain or snow storms or tropical cyclones supplied with increased moisture produce more intense precipitation events Such events are observed to be widely occurring even where total precipitation is decreasing it never rains but it pours This increases the risk of flooding The atmospheric and surface energy budget plays a critical role in the hydrological cycle and also in the slower rate of change that occurs in total precipitation than total column water vapor With modest changes in winds patterns of precipitation do not change much but result in dry areas becoming drier generally throughout the subtropics and wet areas becoming wetter especially in the mid to high latitudes the rich get richer and the poor get poorer This pattern is simulated by climate models and is projected to continue into the future Because with warming more precipitation occurs as rain instead of snow and snow melts earlier there is increased runoff and risk of flooding in early spring but increased risk of drought in summer especially over continental areas However with more precipitation per unit of upward motion in the atmosphere ie more bang for the buck atmospheric circulation weakens causing monsoons to falter In the tropics and subtropics precipitation patterns are dominated by shifts as sea surface temperatures change with El Ni o a good example The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in led to an unprecedented drop in land precipitation and runoff and to widespread drought as precipitation shifted from land to oceans and evaporation faltered providing lessons for possible geoengineering Most models simulate precipitation that occurs prematurely and too often and with insufficient intensity resulting in recycling that is too large and a lifetime of moisture in the atmosphere that is too short which affects runoff and soil moisture

The next generation of scenarios for climate change research and assessment,Advances in the science and observation of climate change are providing a clearer understanding of the inherent variability of Earths climate system and its likely response to human and natural influences The implications of climate change for the environment and society will depend not only on the response of the Earth system to changes in radiative forcings but also on how humankind responds through changes in technology economies lifestyle and policy Extensive uncertainties exist in future forcings of and responses to climate change necessitating the use of scenarios of the future to explore the potential consequences of different response options To date such scenarios have not adequately examined crucial possibilities such as climate change mitigation and adaptation and have relied on research processes that slowed the exchange of information among physical biological and social scientists Here we describe a new process for creating plausible scenarios to investigate some of the most challenging and important questions about climate change confronting the global community

Ground water and climate change,As the worlds largest distributed store of fresh water ground water plays a central part in sustaining ecosystems and enabling human adaptation to climate variability and change The strategic importance of ground water for global water and food security will probably intensify under climate change as more frequent and intense climate extremes droughts and floods increase variability in precipitation soil moisture and surface water Here we critically review recent research assessing the impacts of climate on ground water through natural and humaninduced processes as well as through groundwaterdriven feedbacks on the climate system Furthermore we examine the possible opportunities and challenges of using and sustaining groundwater resources in climate adaptation strategies and highlight the lack of groundwater observations which at present limits our understanding of the dynamic relationship between ground water and climate
Global climate change,A succession of environmental events over the last few years has led to a dramatically increased awareness of the issue of global climate change and to the conviction that global climate change is occurring The anticipated global climate changes are new and unique in that they will have been generated by human activity and could result in largescale disruptions in ecosystems altering the suitability for organisms currently occupying them The goals of both conservation biology and agriculture of feeding an increasing world population and preserving species diversity may be seriously challenged when linked to climate change Anticipated atmospheric changes in precipitation patterns temperature and greenhouse gases could have extreme effects on species and ecosystems Human systems could also be affected especially those based on coastal wetlands or shared river basins Agriculture will be profoundly affected with local regional and global changes occurring Species distribution is likely to be drastically altered as a consequence of global warming © 
Mid to Late Holocene climate change an overview,The last years are of particular interest to the understanding of the Earth System because the boundary conditions of the climate system did not change dramatically in comparison to larger glacialinterglacial changes and because abundant detailed regional palaeoclimatic proxy records cover this period We use selected proxybased reconstructions of different climate variables together with stateoftheart time series of natural forcings orbital variations solar activity variations large tropical volcanic eruptions land cover and greenhouse gases underpinned by results from General Circulation Models GCMs and Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity EMICs to establish a comprehensive explanatory framework for climate changes from the MidHolocene MH to preindustrial time The redistribution of solar energy due to orbital forcing on a millennial timescale was the cause of a progressive southward shift of the Northern Hemisphere NH summer position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone ITCZ This was accompanied by a pronounced weakening of the monsoon systems in Africa and Asia and increasing dryness and desertification on both continents The associated summertime cooling of the NH combined with changing temperature gradients in the world oceans likely led to an increasing amplitude of the El Niño Southern Oscillation ENSO and possibly increasingly negative North Atlantic Oscillation NAO indices up to the beginning of the last millennium On decadal to multicentury timescales a worldwide coincidence between solar irradiance minima tropical volcanic eruptions and decadal to multicentury scale cooling events was not found However reconstructions show that widespread decadal to multicentury scale cooling events accompanied by advances of mountain glaciers occurred in the NH eg in Scandinavia and the European Alps This occurred namely during the Little Ice Age LIA between AD ∼ and when the lower summer insolation in the NH due to orbital forcing coincided with solar activity minima and several strong tropical volcanic eruptions The role of orbital forcing in the NH cooling the southward ITCZ shift and the desertification of the Sahara are supported by numerous model simulations Other simulations have suggested that the fingerprint of solar activity variations should be strongest in the tropics but there is also evidence that changes in the ocean heat transport took place during the LIA at high northern latitudes with possible additional implications for climates of the Southern Hemisphere SH © Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved
Understanding and Attributing Climate Change,Public attitudes about climate change reveal a contradiction Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas GHG emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions Such waitandsee policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident underestimating substantial delays in the climates response to anthropogenic forcing We report experiments with highly educated adults graduate students at MIT showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships including mass balance principles that lead to long response delays GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG removal from the atmosphere GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall stabilizing only when emissions equal removal In contrast most subjects believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it These beliefs analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow support waitandsee policies but violate conservation of matter Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or uncertainty about the impact of climate change Implications for education and communication between scientists and nonscientists the public and policymakers are discussed

Expert credibility in climate change,Although preliminary estimates from published literature and expert surveys suggest striking agreement among climate scientists on the tenets of anthropogenic climate change ACC the American public expresses substantial doubt about both the anthropogenic cause and the level of scientific agreement underpinning ACC A broad analysis of the climate scientist community itself the distribution of credibility of dissenting researchers relative to agreeing researchers and the level of agreement among top climate experts has not been conducted and would inform future ACC discussions Here we use an extensive dataset of climate researchers and their publication and citation data to show that i – of the climate researchers most actively publishing in the field surveyed here support the tenets of ACC outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and ii the relative climate expertise and scientific prominence of the researchers unconvinced of ACC are substantially below that of the convinced researchers
