Sustainable Traditional Medicine Taking the Inspirations from Ancient Veterinary Science,Rapid reduction in natural resources as a consequence to the expanded urbanization global warming and reduced natural habitat posed a considerable threat to the sustainability of traditional medicine Being completely dependent upon natural resources like herbs minerals and animal products traditional medicine would possibly rank first in order of extinction of heritage if an alternative way is not considered well in time In reference to the use of animal products Ayurveda presents some unique examples where animals are used without causing harm to them and so without posing a threat to their existence In the current context when natural resources are facing a threat to their existence a revisit to these ideas may give us a new insight to refine our look at natural resources used in traditional medicine
Application of Signal Analysis to the Climate,The primary ingredient of the Anthropogenic Global Warming hypothesis namely the assumption that additional atmospheric carbon dioxide substantially raises the global temperature is studied This is done by looking at the data of temperature and CO both in the time domain and in the phase domain of periodic data Bicentenary measurements are analyzed and a relaxation model is introduced in the form of an electronic equivalent circuit The effects of this relaxation manifest themselves in delays in the time domain and correlated phase shifts in the phase domain For extremely long relaxation time constants the delay is maximally onequarter period which for the yearlyperiodic signal means months This is not in line with the analyzed data the latter showing delays of − months These results indicate a reverse function of cause and effect with temperature being the cause for atmospheric CO changes rather than their effect These two hypotheses are discussed on basis of literature where it was also reported that CO variations are lagging behind temperature variations
Algae Oil A Sustainable Renewable Fuel of Future,A nonrenewable fuel like petroleum has been used from centuries and its usage has kept on increasing day by day This also contributes to increased production of greenhouse gases contributing towards global issues like global warming In order to meet environmental and economic sustainability renewable carbon neutral transport fuels are necessary To meet these demands microalgae are the key source for production of biodiesel These microalgae do produce oil from sunlight like plants but in a much more efficient manner Biodiesel provides more environmental benefits and being a renewable resource it has gained lot of attraction However the main obstacle to commercialization of biodiesel is its cost and feasibility Biodiesel is usually used by blending with petro diesel but it can also be used in pure form Biodiesel is a sustainable fuel as it is available throughout the year and can run any engine It will satisfy the needs of the future generation to come It will meet the demands of the future generation to come
Effect of Green Technology Investment on a ProductionInventory System with Carbon Tax,Carbon emissions play the central role in global warming Manufacturing firms are significant contributors to carbon emissions In many countries regulatory authorities are taking actions to reduce emissions Carbon taxation and capandtrade schemes are two mechanisms implemented in many countries In the present paper the author analyzes a productioninventory model under a carbon tax system The production rate is assumed to be a decision variable and can be set at any level within machine limits A proportion of items produced are defective and this proportion depends on the production rate Demand depends on the selling price Unit price is a decreasing function of the production rate Emissions can be reduced to some extent by capital investment on green technology and this capital investment amount is a decision variable Customers are categorized as retail customers and wholesale customers A discount is offered to the wholesale customers on the regular selling price The results are illustrated by a numerical example and a sensitivity analysis is performed
Turbulent and Transitional Modeling of Drag on Oceanographic Measurement Devices,Computational fluid dynamic techniques have been applied to the determination of drag on oceanographic devices expendable bathythermographs Such devices which are used to monitor changes in ocean heat content provide information that is dependent on their drag coefficient Inaccuracies in drag calculations can impact the estimation of ocean heating associated with global warming Traditionally oceanheating information was based on experimental correlations which related the depth of the device to the fall time The relation of timedepth is provided by a fallrate equation FRE It is known that FRE depths are reasonably accurate for ocean environments that match the experiments from which the correlations were developed For other situations use of the FRE may lead to depth errors that preclude XBTs as accurate oceanographic devices Here a CFD approach has been taken which provides drag coefficients that are used to predict depths independent of an FRE

Reducing the Environmental Impact of Dietary Choice Perspectives from a Behavioural and Social Change Approach,Climate change is recognised as a significant public health issue that will impact on food security One of the major contributors to global warming is the livestock industry and relative to plantbased agriculture meat production has a much higher environmental impact in relation to freshwater use amount of land required and waste products generated Promoting increased consumption of plantbased foods is a recommended strategy to reduce human impact on the environment and is also now recognised as a potential strategy to reduce the high rates of some chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and certain cancers Currently there is a scant evidence base for policies and programs aiming to increase consumption of plantbased diets and little research on the necessary conditions for that change to occur and the processes involved in such a change This paper reviews some of the environmental and health consequences of current dietary practices reviews literature on the determinants of consuming a plantbased diet and provides recommendations for further research in this area
Application of General Circulation Models to Assess the Potential Impact of Climate Change on Potential Distribution and Relative Abundance of Melanoplus sanguinipes Fabricius Orthoptera Acrididae in North America,Climate is the dominant factor determining the distribution and abundance of most insect species In recent years the issue of climatic changes caused by human activities and the effects on agriculture has raised concern General circulation model scenarios were applied to a bioclimatic model of Melanoplus sanguinipes to assess the potential impact of global warming on its distribution and relative abundance Native to North America and widely distributed M sanguinipes is one of the grasshopper species of the continent most responsible for economic damage to grain oilseed pulse and forage crops Compared to predicted range and distribution under current climate conditions model results indicated that M sanguinipes would have increased range and relative abundance under the three general circulation model scenarios in more northern regions of North America Conversely model output predicted that the range of this crop pest could contract in regions where climate conditions became limiting
Empirical mode decomposition analysis of climate changes with special reference to rainfall data,We have used empirical mode decomposition EMD method which is especially well fitted for analyzing timeseries data representing nonstationary and nonlinear processes This method could decompose any timevarying data into a finite set of functions called “intrinsic mode functions” IMFs The EMD analysis successively extracts the IMFs with the highest local temporal frequencies in a recursive way The extracted IMFs represent a set of successive lowpass spatial filters based entirely on the properties exhibited by the data The IMFs are mutually orthogonal and more effective in isolating physical processes of various time scales The results showed that most of the IMFs have normal distribution Therefore the energy density distribution of IMF samples satisfies χdistribution which is statistically significant This study suggested that the recent global warming along with decadal climate variability contributes not only to the more extreme warm events but also to more frequent long lasting drought and flood
Developing a Collaborative Planning Framework for Sustainable Transportation,Currently as being the highest petroleum consuming sector in the world transportation significantly contributes to the total greenhouse gas emissions in the world Road transportation not only is responsible for approximately of the total emissions of carbon dioxide in the EU and in the US but also has a steadily increasing trend in contributing to global warming Initiatives undertaken by authorities such as Emission cap and trade in the EU limit the emissions resulted from the actions of the companies and also give economic incentives to companies to reduce their emissions However in logistics systems with multiple entities it is difficult to assess the responsibilities of the companies both in terms of costs and emissions In this study we consider a delivery network with multiple customers served by a single carrier which executes a delivery plan with the minimum transportation cost and allocate the resulting costs and the emissions among the customers in a fair manner We develop allocation mechanisms for both costs and emissions In order to develop a mechanism that provides further reduction of the emissions we study a setting where the carrier takes the responsibility of the emissions and reflects the resulting inefficiencies while charging the customers

The Benefits of Supplementary Fat in Feed Rations for Ruminants with Particular Focus on Reducing Levels of Methane Production,"Methane CH a highly potent greenhouse gas has repeatedly been
identified as a significant contributor to global warming In this
connection ruminants animals that produce large quantities of
methane have been singled out as an area for reduction with
regard to their emissions to the atmosphere 
In an analysis of recently published data we identify the
underlying mechanisms of methane production in ruminants and focus
on the efficacy of different fat sources in terms of their ability
to reduce methane production Specific attention has been placed
on in vivo studies involving cattle and sheep as well as studies
based on a large number of animals recorded over a longer
period days and employing reliable techniques for the
quantification of methane production 
Data clearly indicate that supplementary fat given to ruminants
inhibits methane production with mediumchain fatty acids
laurin myristic acid as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids
linoleic and especially linolenic acid having a significant
effect It is also apparent that conflicting findings between
individual published trials can largely be resolved when one takes
into consideration differences in experimental design the

"Possibilities of Simultaneous InCylinder Reduction of Soot and 


 Emissions for Diesel Engines with Direct Injection","Up to now diesel engines with direct fuel injection are the
propulsion systems with the highest efficiency for mobile
applications Future targets in reducing 


 emissions with regard
to global warming effects can be met with the help of these
engines A major disadvantage of diesel engines is the high soot
and nitrogen oxide emissions which cannot be reduced completely
with only engine measures today The present paper describes two
different possibilities for the simultaneous incylinder reduction
of soot and nitrogen oxide emissions One possibility is the
optimization of the injection process with a new injection
strategy the other one is the use of water diesel emulsions with
the conventional injection system The new injection strategy for
this experimental part of the study overcomes the problem of
increased soot emissions with pilot injection by separating the
injections spatially and therefore on the one hand reduces the
soot formation during the early stages of the combustion and on
the other hand increases the soot oxidation later during the
combustion Another method to reduce the emissions is the
introduction of water into the combustion chamber Emulsions of
water and fuel offer the potential to simultaneously reduce 



and soot emissions while maintaining a highthermal efficiency
This article presents a theoretical investigation of the use of
fuelwater emulsions in DIDiesel engines The numerical
simulations are carried out with the DCFD code KIVAV The use
of different water diesel emulsions is investigated and assessed with the numerical model"

Health Effects of Coastal Storms and Flooding in Urban Areas A Review and Vulnerability Assessment,Coastal storms can take a devastating toll on the publics health Urban areas like New York City NYC may be particularly at risk given their dense population reliance on transportation energy infrastructure that is vulnerable to flood damage and highrise residential housing which may be hardhit by power and utility outages Climate change will exacerbate these risks in the coming decades Sea levels are rising due to global warming which will intensify storm surge These projections make preparing for the health impacts of storms even more important We conducted a broad review of the health impacts of US coastal storms to inform climate adaptation planning efforts with a focus on outcomes relevant to NYC and urban coastal areas and incorporated some lessons learned from recent experience with Superstorm Sandy Based on the literature indicators of health vulnerability were selected and mapped within NYC neighborhoods Preparing for the broad range of anticipated effects of coastal storms and floods may help reduce the public health burden from these events
ScenarioBased Analysis on the Structural Change of Land Uses in China,Land UseLand Cover change LUCC is a key aspect of global environmental change which has a significant impact on climate change In the background of increasing global warming resulting from greenhouse effect to understand the impact of land use change on climate change is necessary and meaningful In this study we choose China as the study area and explore the possible land use change trends based on the AgLU module and ERB module of global change assessment model GCAM model and Global Change Assessment Model We design three scenarios based on socioeconomic development and simulated the corresponding structure change of land use according to the three scenarios with different parameters Then we simulate the different emission of CO under different scenarios based on the simulation results of structure change of land use At last we choose the most suitable scenario that could control the emission of CO best and obtain the relatively better land use structure change for adaption of climate change Through this research we can provide a theoretical basis for the future land use planning to adapt to climate change
Asteroids Assessing Catastrophic Risks,"We evaluate two risk profiles i global warming risks and ii collisions with asteroids that can cause the extinction of our species The
expected values computed for these two risks suggest that no action will be taken to avoid extinction The result is somewhat counterintuitive but it is typical of the results of using classic decision theory to evaluate catastrophic risks in the distant future see the study by Posner We establish why expected value is insensitive to catastrophic risks see the study by Chichilnisky and use another criterion to evaluate risk based on axioms for choice under uncertainty that update the classic Von Neumann theory and require equal treatment for rare and frequent events Optimizing according to the new criterion is shown to be equivalent to optimizing expected utility with a restriction on the worst outcome in the case of a catastrophe The evaluation obtained from the new criterion seems more intuitively plausible and suggests a more practical and realistic approach to catastrophic risks optimizing expected value

A FuzzyGrey Multicriteria Decision Making Approach for Green Supplier Selection in LowCarbon Supply Chain,Due to the increasing awareness of global warming and environmental protection many practitioners and researchers have paid much attention to the lowcarbon supply chain management in recent years Green supplier selection is one of the most critical activities in the lowcarbon supply chain management so it is important to establish the comprehensive criteria and develop a method for green supplier selection in lowcarbon supply chain The paper proposes a fuzzgrey multicriteria decision making approach to deal with these problems First the paper establishes main criteria and subcriteria for green supplier selection Then a method integrating fuzzy set theory and grey relational analysis is proposed It uses the membership function of normal distribution to compare each supplier and uses grey relation analysis to calculate the weight of each criterion and improves fuzzy comprehensive evaluation The proposed method can make the localization of individual green supplier more objectively and more accurately in the same trade Finally a case study in the steel industry is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
Investigation of Precipitation Variations over Wet and Dry Areas from Observation and Model,Our observational study revealed that the precipitation increased over the wet area and decreased over the dry area during the past two decades Here we further investigate whether the current atmospheric models can quantitatively capture the characteristics of precipitation from the observation The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies GISS model is used to examine the historic simulation of the precipitation in which the historic greenhouse gases and aerosols are included in the radiative forcing The consistency between the historic GISS simulation and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project GPCP precipitation suggests that the model can qualitatively capture the temporal trends of precipitation over the wet and dry areas However the precipitation trends are weaker in the model than in the observation The observed trends of precipitation do not appear in the control simulation with the fixed concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols which suggests that the global warming due to anthropogenic forcing can influence the temporal variations of precipitation over the wet and dry areas Diagnostic studies of other variables from the model further suggest that enhanced rising air can increase the precipitation over the wet area
Phytochemical Benefits of Agroresidues as Alternative Nutritive Dietary Resource for Pig and Poultry Farming,The growing world population is challenging the animal products supply system particularly in developing countries where demand for meat and milk in is estimated to increase to and respectively amidst deteriorating livestock feed sources Globally adequate production and availability of animal feed products to subsistence farmers has been declining due to factors such as global warming growth in population and low economic growth This paper seeks to examine the existing scientific literature on the utilization of some unconventional feed resources to abate the challenge of feed deficit and thus improve animal nutrition The use of fruit waste and agricultural farm residues affords alternative nutritive livestock dietary supplements it has been proven they contain a spectrum of vital bioactive phytochemicals essential for sustainable growth and development of animals The biochemical composition of the plant wastes and residues include carbohydrates proteins nucleic acids and fatty acids while the common bioactive phytochemicals are polyphenols alkaloids carotenoids and flavonoids along with tannins terpenes and saponins which play vital roles in reducing diseasecausing agents such as bacteria viruses and free radicalassociated diseases The phytochemicals exhibit antioxidant antimicrobial antifungal and antiinflammatory as well as antiparasitic and antiprotozoal properties However it is important to guard against antinutritive and toxicity levels in animal feed products The paper concludes that agroresidueswastes nutritive and therapeutic potential could serve as alternative livestock feed resource while also acting as additional job and income generator for communities

Modeled Impacts of Farming Practices and Structural Agricultural Changes on Nitrogen Fluxes in the Netherlands,In the Netherlands nutrient emissions from intensive animal husbandry have contributed to decreased species diversity in semi natural terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems pollution of groundwater and possibly global warming due to NO emissions This paper presents the results of a modelling study presenting the impacts of both structural measures and improved farming practices on major nitrogen N fluxes including NH and NO emission uptake leaching and runoff in the Netherlands using input data for the year Average annual fluxes Gg N year– for the year were estimated at for NH emission Gg NH year– for NO emission for N inflow to groundwater and for N inflow to surface water at a total N input of At this input nitrate NO concentrations in groundwater often exceeded the target of mg NO l– specifically in welldrained sandy soils The ammonia NH emissions exceeded emission targets that were set to protect the biodiversity of nonagricultural land Improved farming practices were calculated to lead to a significant reduction in NH emissions to the atmosphere and N leaching and runoff to groundwater and surface water but these improvements were not enough to reach all the targets set for those fluxes Only strong structural measures clearly improved the situation The NH emission target of Gg NH year– suggested for the year could not be attained however unless pig and poultry farming is completely banned in the Netherlands and all cattle stay almost permanently in low emission stables
Climate Warming in Response to Emission Reductions Consistent with the Paris Agreement,To limit global warming to well below C in accord with the Paris Agreement countries throughout the world have submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions INDCs outlining their greenhouse gas GHG mitigation actions in the next few decades However it remains unclear what the resulting climate change is in response to the proposed INDCs and subsequent emission reductions In this study the global and regional warming under the updated INDC scenarios was estimated from a range of comprehensive Earth system models CMIP and a simpler carbonclimate model MAGICC based on the relationship of climate response to cumulative emissions The global GHG emissions under the updated INDC pledges are estimated to reach ∼ GtCyear in resulting in a global mean temperature increase of ∼C median of C above the preindustrial level By extending the INDC scenarios to global GHG emissions are estimated to be around ∼ GtCyear in resulting in a global mean temperature increase by ∼C median of C The Arctic warming is projected to be most profound exceeding the global average by a factor of three by the end of this century Thus climate warming under INDC scenarios is projected to greatly exceed the longterm Paris Agreement goal of stabilizing the global mean temperature at to a low level of ‐C above the preindustrial Our study suggests that the INDC emission commitments need to be adjusted and strengthened to bridge this warming gap
Photo reduction of CO to methanol via TiO photocatalyst,"Greenhouse gas such as CO is the primary cause of global warming Alternative energy source
should be provided without producing more CO such as solar energy One of the best routes to remedy
CO is to transform it to hydrocarbons using photo reduction In our study CO was photocatalytically reduced to produce methanol using a Hg lamp with wavelength nm in a steadystate opticalfiber photo
reactor The opticalfiber photo reactor comprised of near CuTiOcoated fibers was designed and
assembled to transmit and spread light uniformly inside reactor TiO film was coated on optical fiber using
dipcoating method Titania and Culoaded solutions were prepared by a thermal hydrolysis method The
thickness of CuTiO film was nm and consisted of very fine spherical particle with diameter of near
 nm The XRD spectra indicated the anatase phase of all TiO and CuTiO films The wavelength of
absorption edge was on nm equivalent to near eV Most active Cu species on TiO surface were CuO clusters and played an important role for the formation of methanol The methanol yield increased with
UV irradiative intensity Photo activity increased with increasing Cu loadings Maximum methanol rate was
 μmolegcat•hr using wtCuTiO catalyst under W cm irradiation bar pressure of CO and seconds mean residence time Higher than wt Cu loading gave less rate of methanol yield
because of the masking effect of CuO clusters on the surface of TiO"
A Complete MCDM Model for NPD Performance Assessment in an LEDBased Lighting Plant Factory,Globally industries and economies have undergone rapid development and expansion over the last several decades As a result global warming and environmental contaminations have resulted in climate change and jeopardized food security In many developing countries already decreasing crop yields are threatened by extreme weather and soil damaged by genetically modified food making environmental problems worse and increasing food and organic product prices For these reasons this study proposes a hybrid multicriteria decisionmaking MCDM model for new product development NPD in the lightemitting diode LED based lighting plant factory First literature reviews and expert interviews are employed in constructing a list of decisionmaking objectives and criteria for new product development Then a fuzzy Delphi method FDM is used to screen the elements of the objectives and criteria while a fuzzy decisionmaking trial and evaluation laboratory FDEMATEL is used to determine the relationships among the objectives and criteria Finally a fuzzy analytic network process FANP and a composite priority vector CPV are manipulated to determine the relative importance weights of the critical objectives and criteria Results show that the proposed method can create a useful and assessable MCDM model for decisionmaking applications in new product development and a case study is herein performed to validate the feasibility of the proposed model in a Taiwanese LEDbased lighting plant factory which not only provides the decisionmakers with a feasible hierarchical data structure for decisionmaking guidance but also increases the competitive advantages of tradeoffs on developing novel products
Qualitative Assessment of Soil Carbon in a Rehabilitated Forest Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy,Logging and poor shifting cultivation negatively affect initial soil carbon C storage especially at the initial stage of deforestation as these practices lead to global warming As a result an afforestation program is needed to mitigate this problem This study assessed initial soil C buildup of rehabilitated forests using Fourier transform infrared FTIR spectroscopy The relatively high EE values of humic acids HAs in the rehabilitated forest indicate prominence of aliphatic components suggesting that the HAs were of low molecular weight The total acidity carboxylic COOH and phenolic OH of the rehabilitated forest were found to be consistent with the ranges reported by other researchers The spectra of all locations were similar because there was no significant difference in the quantities of C in humic acids CHA regardless of forest age and soil depth The spectra showed distinct absorbance at and cm Increase of band at and cm from – to – cm were observed suggesting C buildup from the lowest depths – and – cm However the CHA content in the soil depths was not different The band at cm was assigned to carboxylic and aromatic groups Increase in peak intensity at cm was because CN ratio increased with increasing soil depth This indicates that decomposition rate decreased with increasing soil depth and decreased with CHA The finding suggests that FTIR spectroscopy enables the assessment of C composition functional group buildup at different depths and ages
Research on the Measurement of Carbon Storage in Plantation Tree Trunks Based on the Carbon Storage Dynamic Analysis Method,Estimation of forest carbon storage can be of great significance to the research on the productivity of terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle and global warming China has more than million hm barren hills and waste land suitable for forestation which provides a great potential for developing carbon sink forestry by means of forestation This research analyzed the volume increments volume densities and carbon contents of analytical samples of five main plantation tree species in North China including Pinus tabulaeformis A Robinia pseudoacacia B Populus euramericana C Larix olgenisis D and Larix kaempferi E Results showed that carbon storage dynamic process can be expressed as follows the ages of quantitative maturity of each tree species are a a a a a respectively the average wood densities of each tree species at different age classes are  kgm  kgm  kgm  kgm and  kgmt The average carbon contents of each tree species at different age classes are and It showed a significant difference between the above tree species through variance test The maximum values of average carbon storage are a a a a and a respectively The corresponding average carbon storages are A  kg B  kg C  kg D  kg and E  kg in a descending order of This research through experiment on four tree species with clear growth rings and one tree species with unclear growth rings verified the scientific character and the scope of application of the carbon storage dynamic analysis method providing a new method for the measurement and analysis of forest carbon storage
Agricultural Management Practices to Sustain Crop Yields and Improve Soil and Environmental Qualities,In the past several decades agricultural management practices consisting of intensive tillage and high rate of fertilization to improve crop yields have resulted in the degradation of soil and environmental qualities by increasing erosion and nutrient leaching in the groundwater and releasing greenhouses gases such as carbon dioxide CO and nitrous oxide NO that cause global warming in the atmosphere by oxidation of soil organic matter Consequently management practices that sustain crop yields and improve soil and environmental qualities are needed This paper reviews the findings of the effects of tillage practices cover crops and nitrogen N fertilization rates on crop yields soil organic carbon C and N concentrations and nitrate NON leaching from the soil Studies indicate that conservation tillage such as notill or reduced till can increase soil organic C and N concentrations at to cm depth by as much as – in years compared with conventional tillage without significantly altering crop yields Similarly cover cropping and – kg N ha– year– fertilization can increase soil organic C and N concentrations by as much as – compared with no cover cropping or N fertilization by increasing plant biomass and amount of C and N inputs to the soil Reduced till cover cropping and decreased rate of N fertilization can reduce soil N leaching compared with conventional till no cover cropping and full rate of N fertilization Management practices consisting of combinations of conservation tillage mixture of legume and nonlegume cover crops and reduced rate of N fertilization have the potentials for sustaining crop yields increasing soil C and N storage and reducing soil N leaching thereby helping to improve soil and water qualities Economical and social analyses of such practices are needed to find whether they are cost effective and acceptable to the farmers
New Delivery Systems and Propellants,The removal of chlorofluorocarbon CFC propellants from industrial and household products has been agreed to by over countires of which more than are developing countries The timetable for this process is outlined in the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer document and in several subsequent amendments Pressured metered dose inhalers pMDIs for medical use have been granted temporary exemptions until replacement formulations providing the same medication via the same route and with the same efficacy and safety profiles are approved for human use Hydrofluoroalkanes HFAs are the alternative propellants for CFCs and Their potential for damage to the ozone layer is nonexistent and while they are greenhouse gases their global warming potential is a fraction onetenth of that of CFCs Replacement formulations for almost all inhalant respiratory medications have been or are being produced and tested in Canada it is anticipated that the transition to these HFA or CFCfree pMDIs will be complete by the year Initially an HFA pMDI was to be equivalent to the CFC pMDI being replaced in terms of aerosol properties and effective clinical dose However this will not necessarily be the situation particularly for some corticosteroid products Currently only one CFCfree formulation is available in Canada – Airomir a HFA salbutamol pMDI This paper discusses the in vitro aerosol characteristics in vivo deposition and clinical data for several HFA pMDIs for which there are data available in the literature Alternative delivery systems to the pMDI namely dry powder inhalers and nebulizers are briefly reviewed
Symbiotic RootEndophytic Soil Microbes Improve Crop Productivity and Provide Environmental Benefits,Plants should not be regarded as entities unto themselves but as the visible part of plantmicrobe complexes which are best understood as “holobiomes” Some microorganisms when given the opportunity to inhabit plant roots become root symbionts Such root colonization by symbiotic microbes can raise crop yields by promoting the growth of both shoots and roots by enhancing uptake fixation andor more efficient use of nutrients by improving plants resistance to pests diseases and abiotic stresses that include drought salt and other environmental conditions and by enhancing plants capacity for photosynthesis We refer plantmicrobe associations with these capabilities that have been purposefully established as enhanced plant holobiomes EPHs Here we consider four groups of phylogenetically distinct and distant symbiotic endophytes Rhizobiaceae bacteria plantobligate arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi AMF selected endophytic strains of fungi in the genus Trichoderma and fungi in the Sebicales order specifically Piriformospora indica Although these exhibit quite different “lifestyles” when inhabiting plants all induce beneficial systemic changes in plants gene expression that are surprisingly similar For example all induce gene expression that produces proteins which detoxify reactive oxygen species ROS ROS are increased by environmental stresses on plants or by overexcitation of photosynthetic pigments Gene overexpression results in a cellular environment where ROS levels are controlled and made more compatible with plants metabolic processes EPHs also frequently exhibit increased rates of photosynthesis that contribute to greater plant growth and other capabilities Soil organic matter SOM is augmented when plant root growth is increased and roots remain in the soil The combination of enhanced photosynthesis increasing sequestration of CO from the air and elevation of SOM removes C from the atmosphere and stores it in the soil Reductions in global greenhouse gas levels can be accelerated by incentives for carbon farming and carbon capandtrade programs that reward such climatefriendly agriculture The development and spread of EPHs as part of such initiatives has potential both to enhance farm productivity and incomes and to decelerate global warming
Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Different LandUse Systems A Case Study of CO in the Southern Zone of Ghana,The emission of greenhouse gases GHGs results in global warming and climate change The extent to which developing countries contribute to GHG emissions is not well known This study reports findings on the effects of different landuse systems on GHG emissions CO in this case from two locations in the southern zone of Ghana West Africa Site one located at Kpong contained a heavy clay soil while site two located at Legon contained a lighttextured sandy soil Landuse systems include cattle kraals natural forests cultivated maize fields and rice paddy fields at site one and natural forest woodlots and cultivated soya bean fields at site two CO emissions were measured using the gas entrapment method PVC chambers Trapping solutions were changed every – h and measurement lasted to days depending on the site We found that for the same landuse CO emissions were higher on the clay soil Kpong than the sandy soil Legon In the clay soil environment the highest average CO emission was observed from the cattle kraal  mg·m−·h− followed by the forest  mg·m−·h− and rice paddy  mg·m−·h− field The lowest average emission was observed for maize cropped land  mg·m−·h− In the sandy soil environment the highest average CO emission was observed from soya cropped land  mg·m−·h− followed by the forest  mg·m−·h− and woodlot  mg·m−·h− Several factors influenced CO emissions from the different landuse systems These include the inherent properties of the soils such as texture temperature and moisture content which influenced CO production through their effect on soil microbial activity and root respiration Practices that reduce CO emissions are likely to promote carbon sequestration which will consequently maintain or increase crop productivity and thereby improve global or regional food security
LifeCycle Assessment of HighStrength Concrete Mixtures with Copper Slag as Sand Replacement,Aggregate consumption rates have now exceeded natural renewal rates signaling shortages both locally and globally Even more concerning is that the worldwide markets for construction aggregates are projected to grow at an annual rate of in the near future This increase is attributed to rapid population growth coupled with the economic development worldwide In terms of material availability one of the most vulnerable regions is the AsiaPacific region specifically Singapore where there is higher demand but limited availability of natural sand and gravel for use as aggregates in concrete construction projects This paper focuses mainly on the environmental impacts of fine aggregate alternatives used in highstrength concrete applications in Singapore which is one of the major global importers of natural sand following China Singapore has been experiencing political and environmental challenges linked to the shortage of natural sand use as aggregates even while the demand is increasing in the construction sector Copper slag a readily available waste material from shipyards in Singapore is a possible replacement material for a portion of the natural sand in concrete mixtures thus sustaining the projected growth in the region A lifecycle assessment approach is applied to investigate the environmental impacts of copper slag and its alternative use as natural sand in highstrength concrete applications in Singapore The system boundary consists of the major production processes of concrete constituents including Portland cement and fine and coarse aggregates with CS considered as fine aggregate from a cradletogate perspective consisting of relevant lifecycle phases of raw materials extraction transportation and production processes at the relevant facility where the production occurs Output from the assessment is provided in terms of embodied energy use and air emissions of concrete mixes with varying percentages of copper slag as fine aggregate Results show that environmental impacts of aggregates decrease with the increasing substitution rate of natural sand with copper slag when calculated on the basis per unit volume of the concrete mix For example and sand replacements with copper slag result in a reduction of and in embodied energy and in global warming potential and in acidification and and in particulate matter formation respectively Normalized impacts ie normalized with respect to compressive strength are observed to remain at almost similar levels for concrete mixes with up to natural sand having been replaced with copper slag Therefore it is recommended that replacement of fine aggregates by – of copper slag by weight will produce concrete mixtures with comparable environmental impacts while maintaining feasible durability and strength properties
