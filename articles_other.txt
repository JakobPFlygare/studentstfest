The present study used a 2 x 2 x 2 analysis of variance design to test the effects of sex, task dependence, and task variability in sports on the preferred leadership behavior. Five dimensions of leader behavior in sports were derived through factor analysis and were used. They are Training Behavior, Autocratic Behavior, Democratic Behavior, Social Support, and Rewarding Behavior. The sample included 80 male and 80 female physical education students. The results showed that a) athletes in interdependent sports preferred their coach to emphasize more training behavior than athletes in independent sports; b) athletes in closed sports preferred their coach to emphasize more training behavior than athletes in open sports; c) males preferred more autocratic behavior and social support than female; and d) males in closed sports expected more supportive behavior than males in open sports and all females. The importance of distinguishing between style of behavior and substance of behavior is highlighted.
